		<h1>War Thunder</h1>
		<p>This game is addictive, but not in the cancerous style of addiction you get from LoL:
		<ul>
			<li>Victories are satisfying, and good games by definition last long (because you don't die)</li>
			<li>Defeats aren't too dissatisfying (except for SL uwu), but by definition they don't last long</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The best gamemode: Arcade Ground Battles</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>More balanced (and thus more fun) than Air battles: a tier 1 tank can realistically still win agagainst a tier 3 tank, as tank battles are much more sensitive to tactics and positioning than air dogfights, and less sensitive to tank performance (except mobility). You can sneak up with your BT-5 to the side of an unsuspecting Panther E, and kill the Panzerwehraboowagen in three or four shots.</li> 
			<li>Fast-paced (and thus fun) tank fights, especially when using light and medium tanks. Dog-fights are more like chess, and naval battles are boring.</li>
			<li>Less place to randomness (and thus less frustration) than ground RB: you can see the enemy, they can see you, so it becomes more about quick reflexes and intelligent, fast repositioning while maximizing the benefits of armor angling and aiming for weakspots. You discard the part about frantically looking around in the statistically unlikely hope of seeing a couple of pixels moving, getting unexpectedly sniped from half the map away, and the slower, less responsive vehicles of ground RB.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The best vehicle type: medium tanks</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Using a light tank is begging to get machine gunned by someone in the air, while gaining negligible mobility compared to a t-34 or M41</li>
			<li>Using a heavy tank is very chess-like where you need to get yourself to a position where you don't risk getting flanked, where you have good visual on the enemy (preferrably their flank), and which is attainable without getting rekt halfway through your trip there (which is gonna take a while with your thicc armor).</li>
			<li>A heavy tank is boring and frustrating, and unintuitively much less forgiving than a medium tank: you're less mobile so you're unable to get out of dangerous situations in time to avoid getting apcbc'd.</li>
			<li>Most medium tanks play like light tanks with the difference that you're relatively immune to air machine gun and cannon attacks, unless you're unfortunate enough to be faced with a player with brain cells to understand that his autocannon can definitely pen the top plates of most tanks, often taking out the engine and one or two crew members if he dives vertically enough.</li>
			<li>T-34s are the best in my (limited) experience: very mobile, average weapon, armor that is useless if you're totally exposed but gives some good protection if angled correctly and only a small part of your tank is exposed.</li>
