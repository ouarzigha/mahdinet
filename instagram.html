		<h2>Instagram</h2>
		<aside>Bismillahira7manira7im</aside>
		<p>I first used Instagram around 2016/2017. I overused it, posting almost daily, and often with the intention of showing off and impressing girls. On April 2022 however, I attempted to  deleted my main Instagram account, with two obstacles to overcome: the addiction and the urges it would bring with it, and the fact that many friends I could only communicate with through Instagram. Would I be succesful in removing the app durably?</p>
		<p>The fight to remove instagram was not an instantaneous event. In practice it started in late 2019, with a first, unsuccesful attempt at deleting the social media. I came back to it a couple months after deleting the account, though with slightly more level-headed content instead of the daily spam and show-off it used to be (though neither of these were completely removed afterwards, if anything only the form they took was different). Then came a second part, in late 2021 to early 2022, where I gradually stopped following all active female accounts as well as liberal content, though again urges remained, and the addiction was very much still there.</p>		
		<p>Finally, in April 2022, during Ramadan, I decided to permanently delete my personal Instagram account. I'm typing this a few weeks later, and so far, there has been a surprising lack of urge to rejoin the social media under my main account. I think this is due to:
			<ul>
				<li>The gradual boredom I felt towards the social media during the weeks preceding the deletion, boredom I believe is a positive consequence of removing all females and disagreeable accounts I was following during 2021 and prior.</li>
				<li>The fact that I was still using Instagram after deleting my main account, as I ran the account for a club I was in.</li>
			</ul>
		Running the club account led to a much healthier divorce with instazuck: it provided a relief and a gradual slope for leaving the platform. Time spent on the app was reduced from one or two hours per day to 5 to 30 minutes of daily screentime. In addition to that, running a media for a club meant that I didn't have time to care much about my image of myself, which made for a less narcissistic interaction with Instazucc.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, I'm very happy with how things turned out. I no longer have the guilt of spending multiple hours per day wasting time on a social media carried by the primitive urge of impressing females and displaying my imagined prowesses, and quite fortunately, no downside has been felt yet</p>
